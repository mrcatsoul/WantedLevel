WoW 3.3.5 addon that displays the number and list of players and NPCs targeting us, with a filter option to show only enemies and, if needed, only players. Styled like the 'wanted level' from Grand Theft Auto.

Frames can be dragged with LMB while holding SHIFT. Resize: hold SHIFT + scroll the mouse wheel on the frame. For proper functionality, install the AwesomeWotlk patch: https://github.com/FrostAtom/awesome_wotlk.
